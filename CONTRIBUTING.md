Enhancement
-------------

As Qwerty language and its compiler are being improved, we are open to enhancements.
You can post your enhancement idea in this repository's [Github Issue](https://github.com/gt-tinker/qwerty/issues) and explain how this could improve Qwerty.
This can range from language implementation as Python DSL, Basis translation techniques, or gate generation.

We will review the request and merge it after our approval.
