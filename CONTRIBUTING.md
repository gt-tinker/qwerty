Enhancement
-------------

As Qwerty language and its compiler are being improved, we are open to enhancements.
You can post your enhancement idea in this repository's [Github Issue](https://github.com/gt-tinker/qwerty/issues) and explain how this could improve Qwerty.
This can range from language implementation as Python DSL, Basis translation techniques, or gate generation.
If we think the enhancement will be a valuable addition to Qwerty or its compiler, we will implement it or ask anyone interested in implemented to send a PR request.
We will review the request and merge it after our approval.
