# The (New) Qwerty Compiler

## Project Structure

This repository consists of the following four top-level projects:

1. `qwerty_ast` (Rust): Defines the Qwerty AST and typechecking/optimizations on it
2. `qwerty_mlir` (C++/Tablegen): MLIR dialects/passes for optimizing Qwerty programs and producing OpenQASM 3 or QIR
3. `qwerty_util` (C++): C++ utility code, presently just a wrapper around `tweedledum`
4. `qwerty_pyrt` (Python/Rust): Defines the `qwerty` Python module (in Rust via PyO3), glues together `qwerty_ast` and `qwerty_mlir`, and JITs the resulting IR to simulate with `qir-runner`

There are also the following forks of third-party libraries that referenced as
git submodules:

1. `qir_runner` (Rust): Used for its implementation of the QIR runtime (which
   uses its good quantum simulator)
2. `tweedledum` (C++): Used for synthesizes classical circuits (or classical
   permutations) as quantum circuits
3. `qwerty_mlir_sys` (Rust): Provides [Rust bindings for the C API for MLIR
   dialects][1] (both for ours and for upstream dialects)
4. `qwerty_melior` (Rust): A convenient [wrapper for using MLIR APIs in
   Rust][2]

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

If you are working only on the AST, you need to install only [Rust][3].

Otherwise (e.g., to build the full compiler/runtime), you need to install
[Rust][3] _and_ the following:

1. LLVM 20.1.7 (with MLIR). First, download the LLVM build archive that is
   appropriate for your OS [from our repository][4]. Then you need to set both
   of the following environment variables (assuming `$HOME/bin` is where you
   extracted the LLVM archive, for example):
   ```
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/llvm20/bin/
   $ export MLIR_DIR=$HOME/bin/llvm20/lib/cmake/mlir/
   ```
   You should set these persistently, e.g. in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

2. The following Debian/Ubuntu packages are also needed to build:
   ```
   $ sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build zlib1g-dev libclang-dev
   ```
   If you are not a Debian/Ubuntu user, you can interpret `build-essential`
   above as "a C++ compiler."

The remaining steps on getting started depend on what portion of the compiler
you want to work on.

### Building Just the AST

If you just want to work on the AST, you can work on it in isolation as
follows:

    $ cd qwerty_ast
    $ cargo build

#### Coverage

To get coverage for the AST code, run:

    $ cargo llvm-cov --html

Then you can open `qwerty_ast/target/llvm-cov/html/index.html` (relative to the
repo root) in your browser.

You may need to install `cargo-llvm-cov` first with:

    $ cargo +stable install cargo-llvm-cov --locked

### Fiddling with MLIR

If you only want to work on MLIR (or the other C++ code in `qwerty_util`, or
even `tweedledum`):

    $ git submodule update --init tweedledum
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -G Ninja ..
    $ ninja

Note that the build you just created will not be used by Rust at all. It is
strictly for your separate personal enjoyment.

### Building the Python Extension

To generate the Python extension, run the following:

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ cd qwerty_pyrt
    $ maturin develop

This will (re)build _everything_. Passing `-vv` to `maturin develop` can give
you an idea of what is going on.

To run the Python unit tests, say:

    $ python -m unittest qwerty.tests -v
