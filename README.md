The Compiler for Qwerty, a Basis-Oriented Quantum Programming Language
======================================================================

This is the compiler (and examples) for Qwerty, a quantum programming language
embedded in Python. It is licensed under the MIT license. If you want to contribute
or have issues, you can check out [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Documentation
-------------

The `docs/` directory contains more documentation that does not fit in this
README:

* [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md): An overview
  of the contents of this project (i.e., which files do what) and how the
  sections in the paper submission map to source files.
* [`docs/examples.md`](docs/examples.md): A list of the example
  programs found in the `examples/` directory.
* [`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md): Instructions for building subsets of the
  Qwerty compiler when working on particular components.
* [`docs/upgrading-llvm.md`](docs/upgrading-llvm.md): Describes the
  semi-automated process for upgrading the version of LLVM used by the Qwerty
  compiler.
* [`docs/new-mlir-attr-rust.md`](docs/new-mlir-attr-rust.md): Demonstrates the
  interplay betwen Tablegen, C++, C, and Rust needed to add a new attribute to
  one of our MLIR dialects.

The rest of this README is dedicated to installation, basic testing, and
troubleshooting.

Getting Started
---------------

This guide describes the common case of building the full Qwerty
compiler/runtime. (For instructions on building some portions of the compiler
independently, see [`docs/build.md`](docs/build.md).)

### Dependencies

You need to install [Rust][1] _and_ the following:

1. LLVM 21.1.1 (with MLIR). First, download the LLVM build archive that is
   appropriate for your OS and architecture [from our repository][2]. Then you
   need to set both of the following environment variables (assuming
   `$HOME/bin` is where you extracted the LLVM archive, for example):
   ```
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/llvm21/bin/
   $ export MLIR_DIR=$HOME/bin/llvm21/lib/cmake/mlir/
   ```
   You should set these persistently, e.g., in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

2. The following Debian/Ubuntu packages are also needed to build:
   ```
   $ sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build zlib1g-dev libclang-dev
   ```
   If you are on macOS, installing the XCode developer tools is enough and the
   command above is not needed.

### Building

To generate the Python extension, run the following:

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ cd qwerty_pyrt
    $ pip install maturin numpy
    $ maturin develop -vvv

The last command will (re)build _everything_. Passing `-vvv` to
`maturin develop` helps to give you an idea of what is going on.

### Testing

As a quick smoke test, you can run a single Qwerty program from `examples/` as
follows:

    $ python ../examples/deutsch.py
    Balanced f:
    Classical: f(0) xor f(1) = 1
    Quantum:   f(0) xor f(1) = 1

    Constant f:
    Classical: f(0) xor f(1) = 0
    Quantum:   f(0) xor f(1) = 0

To run _all_ tests across the compiler, run the following:

    $ ../dev/run-tests.sh

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your compilation process keeps getting sniped by the OOM killer, as seen
below:

    c++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus
      compilation terminated.

Then a potential fix is to add the following code near the top of your
`CMakeLists.txt` both in `/` and  `/tweedledum`:

    set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY JOB_POOLS link_job_pool=1)
    set(CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK link_job_pool)
    set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY JOB_POOLS compile_job_pool=1)
    set(CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE compile_job_pool)

This tells CMake to tell Ninja to limit the number of linking and compilation
jobs done in parallel to just 1 each, although this can be changed by changing
the above parameters.
