Upgrading LLVM
==============

Updating LLVM is not the most fun thing in the world, but on the bright side,
it often brings bugfixes and improved APIs. The first step of updating the LLVM
dependency is to update the LLVM submodule we use to track the current LLVM commit
we're compatible with (CIRCT does something similar):

    $ git update-index --cacheinfo 160000,e21dc4bd5474d04b8e62d7331362edcc5648d7e5,tpls/llvm

The next step is replacing every occurrence of `llvm19`, `19_1_6`, and
`19.1.6` in `README.md` and all `docs/*.md` files. This is useful (make
sure to check the results are right):

    $ git help sed
    'sed' is aliased to '! git ls-files -s -z | grep -z -v '^16' | cut -z -f 2- | xargs -0 sed -i -e'
    $ git sed 's/\<llvm18\>/llvm19/g' -e 's/v18_1_8/v19_1_6/g' -e 's/\<18_1_8\>/19_1_6/g' -e 's/\<18\.1\.8/19.1.6/g'

To rebuild the tarballs, see the scripts under `ci/`. `build-llvm.sh` has been
tested on macOS and GNU/Linux, and `build-windows/build-llvm.ps1` is for
Windows. Note it's a solid idea to delete `_skbuild` if you are testing a new
LLVM release, since the existing version may reference the previous LLVM
version. (Also, for Windows, `ci/build-windows/setup-env.bat` sets a lot of
annoying variables useful for building Qwerty on Windows.)

Finally, for my own convenience when copy-pasting:

    $ aws s3 cp llvm_mlir_rel_v19_1_6_x86_linux.tar.xz s3://austinjadams-com-test/qwerty/
