Qwerty Examples
===============

You can find some example Qwerty programs in the `examples/` directory. You can
run any of them like any Python script, as `./dj.py` or `python dj.py`. Most
take command-line arguments; you can see a description by passing `--help` to
any example. The examples are the following:

* `coin_flip.py`: Prepare a uniform superposition of 0 and 1 and measure, like
  flipping a coin
* `bell.py`: Prepares a [Bell state][1] and prints measurement statistics
* `ghz.py`: Prepares a [GHZ][2] state (a Bell state generalized to more than
  two qubits) and measures it. Takes number of qubits as command-line argument
* `deutsch.py`: Deutsch's algorithm from Section 1.4.3 of Nielsen and Chuang
* `dj.py`: [Deutsch-Jozsa][3], Deutsch's algorithm generalized to functions
  who take more than one bit of input . Based on Section 1.4.4 of Nielsen and
  Chuang
* `bv.py`: [Bernsteinâ€“Vazirani][4], effectively a quantum "Hello World".
  Takes the secret bitstring $s$ as a command-line argument
* `grover.py`: [Grover's Algorithm][5], aka unstructured search. The
  oracle is pretty trivial, currently looking for all 1s. Based on Section
  6.1 of Nielsen and Chuang. The (required) command line argument is the
  number of qubits.
* `period.py`: A fun example of finding the period of a function based on
  Section 5.4.1 of Nielsen and Chuang.
* `simon.py`: Simon's algorithm ([1][6], [2][7]), the first quantum algorithm
  to promise exponential speedup
  * `simon_postprocess.py`: Full [classical post-processing][8] for Simon's
* `teleport.py`: Quantum teleportation, a procedure for transmitting a qubit by
  consuming an entangled pair of qubits, as described in Section 1.3.7 of
  Nielsen and Chuang
* `superdense.py`: Superdense coding, a technique for transmitting two
  classical bits using one qubit, as described in Section 2.3 of Nielsen and
  Chuang
* `abbrev/`: These are abbreviated examples originally from the QCE '25 paper
  but intended to be shown the Qwerty website. Unlike examples in the parent
  directory, these do not contain `argparse` command line argument handling,
  for example.
