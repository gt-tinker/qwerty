Qwerty Examples
===============

You can find some example Qwerty programs in the `examples/` directory. You can
run any of them like any Python script, as `./dj.py` or `python dj.py`. Most
take command-line arguments; you can see a description by passing `--help` to
any example. The examples are the following:

* `coin_flip.py`: Prepare a uniform superposition of 0 and 1 and measure, like
  flipping a coin
* `bell.py`: Prepares a [Bell state][1] and prints measurement statistics
* `ghz.py`: Prepares a [GHZ][2] state (a Bell state generalized to more than
  two qubits) and measures it. Takes number of qubits as command-line argument
* `deutsch.py`: Deutsch's algorithm from Section 1.4.3 of Nielsen and Chuang
* `dj.py`: [Deutsch-Jozsa][3], Deutsch's algorithm generalized to functions
  who take more than one bit of input . Based on Section 1.4.4 of Nielsen and
  Chuang
* `bv.py`: [Bernsteinâ€“Vazirani][4], effectively a quantum "Hello World".
  Takes the secret bitstring $s$ as a command-line argument
